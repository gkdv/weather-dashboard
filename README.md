# weather-dashboard

Weather-dashboard is a webpage that will return weather information on a searched city. Functionality is
limited. cities are not stored in local memory and after a city is searched and it is appended to the list
below the search bar you cannot click on it to call its information. future versions will include the missing
features.

To get started type in a city in the search bar and the webpage will ping OpenWeather.com api for current
and 5 day forecasted weather.
